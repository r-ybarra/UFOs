# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create an html website that would allow the user to search through UFO sighting records.

## Results
![ufo_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83841580/132148335-6830e805-6c2d-4c76-b040-dd17a70219e0.png) <br />
The webpage automatically loads all of the records. To filter through them the user can enter different search criteria on the left side. <br /><br />

![filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83841580/132148384-ac7fa8ef-f14c-4d51-9650-76245359e3ba.png) <br />
The user can choose from date, city, state, country, and shape by just typing into the corresponding box and pressing the "enter" key. Examples are provided. <br /><br />

Once a filter is applied the results are automatically updated on the right side. <br /><br />

## Summary
The site was a success and functions as expected. However, one drawback of this webpage is that the information is tightly packed together and hard to read. I would recommend more spacing and styling. Additionally, to improve user experience dropdown lists should be added to the filters so that users can search rather that type if they choose. Lastly, the search boxes take anything that user inputs. Those should be more rigid to keep the user from passing anything unexpected.
